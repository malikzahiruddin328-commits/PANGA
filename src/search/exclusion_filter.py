"""Search-time exclusion filter that stops predictably-poor-fit jobs from
ever entering data/jobs/jobs.json in the first place, so they never reach
tailoring.fit_score's paid Opus call at all (real analysis, 2026-08-12,
following the same week's tailoring.fit_score_prefilter build: a large
fraction of jobs that fit_score scores near-zero are knowable from the
TITLE ALONE, before spending a single paid call - 27/28 real AbbVie jobs
scored <=60 followed the seniority pattern below, and clinical-domain
titles score 0 with an unambiguous rationale every time).

Unlike tailoring.fit_score_prefilter (which runs just before a scoring
call, on jobs already sitting in the store), this runs on EVERY job coming
out of EVERY search channel (USAJOBS, ZipRecruiter, Dice, Indeed, company
sites, industry boards) before search.job_store.save_jobs() ever writes a
record - so it must stay purely deterministic (no AI call, no network
call) to be cheap enough to run at that volume. Two layers:

1. Seniority-tier exclusion: the candidate (Zahir) is a 25-year VP/CIO/
   Head-of-IT executive. An individual-contributor-tier noun in the title
   (Engineer, Analyst, Specialist, Consultant, Scientist, Representative,
   Coordinator, Associate) almost always means a near-zero fit_score
   regardless of domain match - UNLESS the title is also Director-level or
   above (Director, VP, Vice President, Head, Chief, President, SVP,
   EVP), which qualifies it back in. "Senior Systems Engineer" excludes
   (Engineer, no qualifier); "Senior Director" and "Associate Director"
   both keep (Director qualifies "Associate" the same way it qualifies
   "Senior").
2. Clinical/medical domain exclusion: Medical Director, Physician, Nurse
   Practitioner, Registered Nurse, Clinical Research/Development/
   Scientist/Pharmacology, Medical Science Liaison, Medical Advisor -
   verified: "Senior Medical Director, Hematology Clinical Development" at
   AbbVie scored 0 four separate times with an identical "clinical role,
   no domain overlap" rationale. This layer is deliberately independent of
   layer 1 - "Medical Director" carries an executive-qualifying word
   ("Director") that would otherwise keep it, so the clinical check must
   run regardless of the seniority verdict, not only when seniority
   already excluded it.

Non-negotiable per Zahir's standing "never silently dropped" rule (the
same one tailoring.fit_score_prefilter follows): an excluded job is never
just gone. Every exclusion is appended to
data/jobs/search_exclusion_log.json (same locked-write pattern as
prefilter_log.json) BEFORE job_store.save_jobs() ever gets a chance to
write the job into jobs.json - the log is the only record these jobs ever
existed, so it must be written unconditionally, not best-effort.
